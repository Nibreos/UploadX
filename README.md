UploadX - A PHP-based ShareX proxy for simple file uploading. This script allows you to easily upload your files from ShareX to your server, instead of the other public hosts.


## Instalation

  1. Copy `index.php` to the directory where it will be run, such as `/yoursite/uploads/`.
  2. You're done. That was easy.
  
  
## Configuration

UploadX is very straight-forward, just open up `index.php` in a text editor of your choice. All of the cofiguration settings are explaied at the top of the file.
